Submitted by: **Clinton Nwokike**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath-prework-game-clinton)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Create Difficulty levels to choose from which would provide more buttons to keep up with, different speeds and shorter times to reply.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/math/random

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words): 
I found figuring out the Handling guesses a bit hard, just because I wasn't too used to the javascript syntax, but it wasn't too hard because I ended up figuring it out since it felt like a mix of python and c++ which are two languages I've used a fair bit in the past(I had to read the documentation). Figuring out the math.random was also a bit confusing, I kept thinking do I have to import a random variable to access this or just call it, but thank you for the link that helped a ton and stackoverflow as well. If I didn't have so many time constraints conscerning exams and homeworks given my very hectic schedule this semester I would've loved to work mor eon this, javasript is a really interesting language.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I'm just wondering what libraries are available, what functions I can call, I also keep hearing about angular vs react so what the difference is really and if what I've done falls under either of them. Do i always only need these 3 files to create an interactive website (CSS, HTML and JS), and how websites connect to database to store the information users input.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I didn't have so many time constraints conscerning exams and homeworks given my very hectic schedule this semester I would've loved to work mor eon this, javasript is a really interesting language. I would've loved to try implementing the limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn and the player loosing only after 3 turns. I think those two additions would make the game much more immersive and fun, maybe implement difficulty levels so players can switch between 3 turns for "Easy", 1 turn for "Medium and No turns for "very hard" and then change the rate at which the speed gets faster with each selection
